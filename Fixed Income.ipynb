    "##### Term Structure of Interest Rates\n",
    "When we think about bonds, we think about different interest rates for each time period rather than different payments for each time period. This is called the term structure of interest rates, which is _different_ from the yield curve, although they're often conflated. As a result, the new PV formula looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PV = \\frac{C_1}{1+r_1} + \\frac{C_2}{(1+r_2)^2} + ... + \\frac{C_T}{(1+r_T)^T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the term structure of interest rates is upward sloping, it means that there is an expectation that interest rates are going to increase over time. The terms slope upwards because it takes a higher interest rate to induce lenders to want to part with their capital over that period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the term structure is over an indefinite period of time, it gives us information about what the market thinks the term structure will look like at each year in the future as well."
